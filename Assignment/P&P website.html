<p><h1>Announcing Pen & Pixel 2011 in Clonmel</h1><br><br>
Creative multimedia students in LIT Tipperary proudly announce the unveiling of the Pen & Pixel Exhibition next Thursday evening on the Clonmel campus on 14th April at 6.30pm. The event features dozens of exceptional photographs, clever animations and immersive soundscapes that will convert the hallways and classrooms of the third level college into an art gallery.<br><br>

Fiona Kearney, a third level student in the creative multimedia degree course, says, "Seeing your best work on display is one of the best ways to share ideas with friends. And I'm bringing everyone who has told me they want to make LIT-Tipperary multimedia their number one CAO choice."
Sean O'Grady, the web developer for several award-winning Irish Blog Awards sites, put together PenandPixel.ie, a showcase of multimedia artwork. "The most commonly visited image is the candles in a darkroom," Sean reveals. It's shot by Rebecca White, a second year student from Cahir. Will that image be the "Best of Show"? That honour will go to the image selected by Wojciech Ryzinski, an eminent local photographer who had a difficult time culling hundreds of images down to the 60 and will announce the winners on the night of the Exhibition.<br><br>
Pen & Pixel is an annual event run by LIT-Tipperary. It marks the 8th year that the LIT-Tipperary has run third level multimedia degree courses in Clonmel. Since that time, graduates have taken their degrees into the workforce, landing jobs as interface designers, website project managers, web developers, database administrators and social media marketers.â€‹
